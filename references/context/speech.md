## The packed transcript (primary reading view)

`pack_transcripts.py` reads all `transcripts/*.json` and produces one markdown file where each take is a list of phrase-level lines, each prefixed with its `[start-end]` time range. Phrases break on any silence ≥ 0.5s OR speaker change. This is the artifact the editor sub-agent reads to pick cuts — it gives word-boundary precision from text alone at 1/10 the tokens of raw JSON.

Example line:
```
## C0103  (duration: 43.0s, 8 phrases)
  [002.52-005.36] S0 Ninety percent of what a web agent does is completely wasted.
  [006.08-006.74] S0 We fixed this.
```

## Editor sub-agent brief (for multi-take selection)

When the task is "pick the best take of each beat across many clips," spawn a dedicated sub-agent with a brief shaped like this. The structure is load-bearing; the pitch-shape example is not.

```
You are editing a <type> video. Pick the best take of each beat and 
assemble them chronologically by beat, not by source clip order.

INPUTS:
  - takes_packed.md (time-annotated phrase-level transcripts of all takes)
  - Product/narrative context: <2 sentences from the user>
  - Speaker(s): <name, role, delivery style note>
  - Expected structure: <pick an archetype or invent one>
  - Verbal slips to avoid: <list from the pre-scan pass>
  - Target runtime: <seconds>

Common structural archetypes (pick, adapt, or invent):
  - Tech launch / demo:   HOOK → PROBLEM → SOLUTION → BENEFIT → EXAMPLE → CTA
  - Tutorial:             INTRO → SETUP → STEPS → GOTCHAS → RECAP
  - Interview:            (QUESTION → ANSWER → FOLLOWUP) repeat
  - Travel / event:       ARRIVAL → HIGHLIGHTS → QUIET MOMENTS → DEPARTURE
  - Documentary:          THESIS → EVIDENCE → COUNTERPOINT → CONCLUSION
  - Music / performance:  INTRO → VERSE → CHORUS → BRIDGE → OUTRO
  - Or invent your own.

RULES:
  - Start/end times must fall on word boundaries from the transcript.
  - Pad cut boundaries (working window 30–200ms).
  - Prefer silences ≥ 400ms as cut targets.
  - Unavoidable slips are kept if no better take exists. Note them in "reason".
  - If over budget, revise: drop a beat or trim tails. Report total and self-correct.

OUTPUT (JSON array, no prose):
  [{"source": "C0103", "start": 2.42, "end": 6.85, "beat": "HOOK",
    "quote": "...", "reason": "..."}, ...]

Return the final EDL and a one-line total runtime check.

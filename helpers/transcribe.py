"""Transcribe a video with ElevenLabs Scribe.

Extracts mono 16kHz audio via ffmpeg, uploads to Scribe with verbatim +
diarize + audio events + word-level timestamps, writes the full response
to <edit_dir>/transcripts/<video_stem><video_ext>.json.

Cached: if the output file already exists, the upload is skipped. Transcripts written
before the extension was part of the name (<video_stem>.json) are still found and reused,
except where another take in the same directory shares the stem and the old file cannot be
told apart from it.

Usage:
    python helpers/transcribe.py <video_path>
    python helpers/transcribe.py <video_path> --edit-dir /custom/edit
    python helpers/transcribe.py <video_path> --language en
    python helpers/transcribe.py <video_path> --num-speakers 2
